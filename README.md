`Drashta` is a web-based tool that parses system logs and displays security relevant events in a beautiful way - (I guess, will see how it goes)

Main Goal is to have the ability to watch/detect suspicious activity like - maybe failed logins, unauthorized sudo attempts, package changes, and system warnings, etc..
